            <p>The <b>Pokots</b> are a group of Pokot speaking people who belong to the Nilotic ethnic group.</p>
            <p>Their cradle land is believed to be Ethiopia. They are believed to have migrated
                from their cradle land because of many reasons as discussed here.

                About one quarter of Pokot peoples are cultivators ("corn people") cultivating Maize and Sorghum, while the remaining are pastoralists ("cow people").
                Among both groups, however, wealth is measured by the number of cows one owns.
                Cows are used for barter, exchange, and most importantly as a form of bride wealth. A man is permitted to marry more than one woman,
                as long as he has sufficient number of cows to offer to her family in exchange. This is the primary way for wealth and resources to change hands in Pokot society. 
                Cows are rarely slaughtered for meat because they are much more valuable alive. They provide milk, butter, and cheese, which provide an important component of Pokot dietary needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                The position of women in Pokot society is weak.
                A woman has no voice in any public forums and no authority within her own homestead.
                She is considered "foolish", like the cows for which she is traded. Illness and death are greatly feared among the Pokot.
                Much of their religious ritual is involved in warding off illness or in effecting cures.
                The majority of the Pokot still follow their traditional religion.
                Some of Pokot are Christians but the majority are traditionalists. Even among the Christians, the traditional religion worldview is still dominant.

            <p>
            <i>Tӧrorӧt</i> is considered the supreme god among Pokot. Prayers and offerings are made to him during communal gatherings, including feasts and dances.
            Such ceremonies are usually presided over by a community elder. Diviners and medicine men also play a significant role in maintaining spiritual balance within the community.
            Pokot believe in sorcery and use various forms of protection to escape the ill will of sorcerers. Pokot also revere a series of other deities, including sun and moon deities and a spirit who is believed to be connected with death
            Dances and feasts are held to thank the god for the generosity and abundance, which he bestows upon Pokot communities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pokot society is governed through a series of age-grades. Group membership is determined by the age at which one undergoes initiation.
                For young men it's called <i>'Menjӧ'</i> a.k.a <i>Male Circumcision</i> this occurs between ages fifteen and twenty, while for young women it is called <i>Mutat'</i> a.k.a <i> FGM</i> which usually occurs around age twelve at the onset of menarche.
                After initiation, young people are allowed to marry and are permitted to begin participating in local economic activities.
                Young men and women form close bonds with other members of their initiation groups, and these bonds serve for future political ties.
                When a man or woman reaches old age among Pokot, he or she is accorded a certain degree of status and respect.
                Responsibilities of elders include presiding over important community decisions, festivals, and religious ceremonies.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Pokot people have developed a social structure and cultural practices which aim to optimize the chance of survival of the community in an often difficult and hostile environment.
                When examined in detail, some of these practices are seen to be beneficial, while others are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in the area of mother and child health.
                In recent times, Pokot society has been in a phase of transition, influenced by new opportunities of educational, economic and social interaction.
